# BSE2 - Redward Cullen Engine

The BSE2 or the Redward Cullen Engine is a massive improvement over its predecessor BSE (Ball Square Engine).

The biggest upgrade is that it can not only render balls and squares but also regular sprites.

While its perfectly cross platform, I haven't made scripts for to build it on linux and mac.

For windows, just go to scripts and run gen.bat (first time set-up), then drun.bat (debug build) or run.bat (release build)

You need vcpkg and you need to set the VCPKG_ROOT variable.

There is some code in sandbox to show you how to use the engine.
